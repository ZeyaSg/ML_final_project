The fingerprint reader is a con but its also a pro. More often then not, when the screen is dark, before the lock screen pops up its almost impossible to input fingerprint data. Idk why but as soon as u click above the fingerprint reader and the lock screen pops up... it works like a charm every time. Why is this good.. well because even with my fingerprint ppl would have a hard time getting into my phone... thanks for the glitch samsung.<br />That being said Im ranked top ten thousand in the world on multiple mobile gaming platforms. I push my phone to the very max and it doesnt flinch! I can have asphalt 8 mobile stremed on my tv while using a bluetooth PS remote and so im using the phone as a console wirelessly and still my phone doesnt even hesitate. Granted im running good guardians app so i can push the threshold and max out my CPU but any civilian with google can do the same thing and enjoy the best phone out their. Tbh the new s21+ and s22+ do not even have 4k screens and so i wouldnt even consider them! For me the Ultra is way overpriced because this phone does everything i need it to and even exceeds my expectations on so many other levels if i were to write about all the accolades id have a book.

Fortunately I found these Samsung S20+ 'Amazon Refurbished' cell phones.<br /><br />The unit that received was in immaculate condition with no cosmetic blemishes that I could find. Display is crystal clear and the camera(s) work perfectly. This unit worked perfectly right out of the box. All I did was move my SIM card and micro SD card from my old phone. All of my apps and settings transferred painlessly from my old phone. It even transferred which bluetooth devices that I had paired with my old cell phone. I had to repair the devices but it was much easier not having to scan for devices and then pair them.<br /><br />In summary this was a great purchase from a reliable seller. Incidentally they shipped it almost immediately and it arrived one day earlier than Amazon estimated.<br /><br />I can highly recommed this seller and this cell phone to those who might need to upgrade like I did.\",\n",

              "{'review': 'I love the Samsung Galaxy line of phones and the S20+ is their best yet!  The only bummer is the seller sent me a dysfunctional phone at first  then the replacement they sent me was completely scratched up on the top and bottom! :That being said Im ranked top ten thousand in the world on multiple mobile gaming platforms. I push my phone to the very max and it doesnt flinch! I can have asphalt 8 mobile stremed on my tv while using a bluetooth PS remote and so im using the phone as a console wirelessly and still my phone doesnt even hesitate. Granted im running good guardians app so i can push the threshold and max out my CPU but any civilian with google can do the same thing and enjoy the best phone out their. Tbh the new s21+ and s22+ do not even have 4k screens and so i wouldnt even consider them! For me the Ultra is way overpriced because this phone does everything i need it to and even exceeds my expectations on so many other levels if i were to write about all the accolades id have a book. N e way best phone, for the buck, ive ever laid my hands on!I needed to replace my old 3G cell phone with one that has 5G capability. What I didn\\'t want to do was spend $800 to $1900 on a current state of the art cell phone. Fortunately I found these Samsung S20+ \\'Amazon Refurbished\\' cell phones.The unit that received was in immaculate condition with no cosmetic blemishes that I could find. Display is crystal clear and the camera work perfectly. This unit worked perfectly right out of the box. All I did was move my SIM card and micro SD card from my old phone. All of my apps and settings transferred painlessly from my old phone. It even transferred which bluetooth devices that I had paired with my old cell phone. I had to repair the devices but it was much easier not having to scan for devices and then pair them.In summary this was a great purchase from a reliable seller. Incidentally they shipped it almost immediately and it arrived one day earlier than Amazon estimated.I can highly recommed this seller and this cell phone to those who might need to upgrade like I did.Todo me agrado de este celular la pila dura todo el da y no me debo de preocupar, por estarlo cargando durante el daY lo de las huellas dactilares es muy fcil de usar no tengo ningn problemaSi volveria a comprar uno de estos celulares de verdad que si lo recomiendo. The network connection works great, but there\\'s a notification that won\\'t go away saying  the activation to the network did not work, and keeps retracing, which wastes the battery. Fingerprint scanner sucks... the one on the S9 was way better than the one thru the screen. Facial recognition sometimes worked, sometimes didn\\'t, so I turned it off. Now I\\'m back to the pin to unlock my screen Not sure if it is this model phone, or just the refurb that I received. But the battery is going from 100% to below 50% before it is even Noon, with bluetooth off. Seems way too fast for something that will only degrade more from here.Update: after 2 weeks the battery life is only 24 hours on power saving mode...that is nowhere near 75% capacity as claimed.Phone would continously update even after update was installed . Then the camera does not work. Even after clearing the cache, starting in safe mode, deleting files, and finally resetting from scratch  the camera did not work. I always got the message \"camera failed\" . They obviously did not do a quality check on this refurb.] Celular con pantalla defectuosa y no cumple con las especificaciones.Phone broke after 1 month of being used. We contacted the vendor and they don\\'t do anything.Please dont buy from themVery excited to get an overnight delivery of my replacement phone but on power up I found dead pixels on the left side and the metal edge all around the phone was chewed up.  This is NOT excellent condition!  I did not give it 1 star because the actual phone was clean  and in that regard it exceeded my expectation.  Unfortunately, it was not in the shape I paid for so back it goes to Amazon.Phone with a charging port moisture lock once I finished updating it. Phone was unusable after that. Had to return.Bought two for my wife and I plenty of space for apps and able to take an SD card if necessary, camera is really good I bought this phone as a guft and still working great. Fast shipping as well.Phone came clean and ready to setup with no software issues. Had slight scratches on the screen and on the edges of the phone. Came as stated in the description so can\\'t complain about the defects. Phone battery lasts longer than my S9 and the applications run very smooth comparatively.Very good productCan\\'t beat the value on this phone. Phone received in immaculate condition; I don\\'t think it has ever been used. After software updates it is now running Android 13, a huge improvement over previous android versions. Phone arrived in two days, a 2020 flagship model for an incredible price.The ad for this phone says, \"This phone is compatible with carriers on the GSM network .\"  Well the one that I received could not be connected to T-Mobile.  Thanks for wasting my time!this imei not compatible with verizon network.The received phone does not match criteria of an excellent condition Amazon Renewed item. The biggest problems were:- Significant ghost images on the screen due to burn-in- Significant scratches and damage to the body- Minor but noticeable scratches on the screen- 10W charger instead of 25W. It\\'s fine that it\\'s generic rather than OEM, but it should be a generic 25W charger to be considered \"fully functional\".The scratches would qualify this phone as \"Acceptable condition\", not \"Excellent condition\". The burn-in and inadequate charger are unacceptable.Phone works perfectlyPhone arrived in like brand new condition! Thanks so much!Phone is good as new. Thanks youPhone was received in great condition. It looks new without any scratches. One major problem, however, is that while it says fully unlocked, the sim management is locked and as such esim cannot be added. That\\'s a disappointment as I cannot add my esim number.'}"
